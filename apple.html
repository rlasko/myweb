            <h6 id="description">Epileptic seizures are classified as symptomatic if they can be identified with a specific cause, such as infection, trauma, tumor, vascular malformation, toxic chemicals, very high fever, or other neurological disorders. Seizures are idiopathic if they appear spontaneously and in the absence of other diseases of the central nervous system.</h6>

        In constraint-induced therapy, the intact limb is held in a sling for several hours per day, forcing the patient to use the impaired limb. There is nothing magical about Taubâ€™s procedure: virtually any treatment that forces patients to practice behaviors extensively is successful. An important component of these treatments, however, is a posttreatment contract in which the patients continue to practice after the formal therapy is completed. If they fail to do so, the chances for learned nonuse and a return of symptoms are high.
Another common effect of stroke is loss of speech. Specific speech therapy programs can aid in the recovery of speech. Music and singing, mediated in part by the right hemisphere, can augment speech therapy after left-hemisphere stroke.
Therapies using pharmacological interventions (e.g., noradrenergic, dopaminer- gic, cholinergic agonists) combined with behavioral therapies provide equivocal gains in stroke patients. The bulk of evidence suggests that patients with small, gray-matter strokes are most likely to show benefits from these treatments, whereas those with large strokes that include white matter show little benefit.
Finally, there have been many attempts to use either direct cortical stimulation or TMS in combination with behavioral therapy as a stroke treatment. The idea is to induce plasticity in regions adjacent to the dead tissue with the goal of enhancing the efficiency of the residual parts of the neuronal networks. These treatments have proved beneficial in patients with good residual motor control, but again, those with larger injuries show much less benefit, presumably because a sufficient residual neuronal network is not available.
