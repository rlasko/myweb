        <h6>Before I arrived at Carnegie Mellon, I had never programmed before. A few weeks after class started, I began working for a psychology professor as a research engineer on his project. 4 months later I landed a software engineering internship with the Apple notes team</h6>
        <h6>Unfortunately, the specifics of the work I did at Apple is confidential, though I'm able to share general information.</h6>
        <h6>My internship lasted 11 weeks and consisted of working on an experimental project. Though I was primarily responsible for the project, I worked closely with the other 8 members of my team.</h6>
